//2. BankAccount.java (Encapsulation)
//Purpose: 
//- BankAccount is a concrete class that extends Account. 
//- It represents a regular bank account with no interest calculation.
//
//Encapsulation: 
//- The class encapsulates the data (accountNumber, balance) 
//  and provides controlled access to it through methods like deposit and withdraw. 
//- ensuring Direct access to the balance is restricted,that any changes to it are 
//  made through these methods, maintaining data integrity.

public class BankAccount extends Account{
	
	public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance, AccountHolder accountHolder) {
        super(accountNumber, initialBalance, accountHolder);
    }
	
	@Override
	public void calculateInterest() {
	//	System.out.println("No interest for regular bank account");
	}
