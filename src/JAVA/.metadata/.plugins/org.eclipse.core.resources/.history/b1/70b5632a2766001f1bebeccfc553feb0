//1. Account.java (Abstraction)
//
//Purpose:
//- Account is an abstract class that serves as a blueprint for different types of bank accounts. 
//- It defines common properties (accountNumber and balance) and methods (deposit, withdraw, getBalance)
//  that all types of accounts will have.
//
//- Abstraction: 
//- The class is abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. 
//- It includes an abstract method calculateInterest(), which must be implemented by 
//  any subclass. 
//- This allows us to define a general structure for all accounts while leaving the 
//  specific implementation of interest calculation to each subclass.
