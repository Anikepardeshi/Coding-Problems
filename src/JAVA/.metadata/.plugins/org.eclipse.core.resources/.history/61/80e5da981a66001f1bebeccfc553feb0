package bank;

//5. Bank.java (Polymorphism)
//Purpose: 
//- Bank is a class that contains methods to perform operations on any Account.
//- It demonstrates how polymorphism allows us to write generic code that works with 
//  any subclass of Account.
//Polymorphism: 
//- The methods showAccountDetails(Account account) and applyInterest(Account account) 
//  accept any object of type Account. At runtime, the specific type of account 
//  (SavingsAccount, FixedDepositAccount) determines which calculateInterest() method is called. 
//- This is polymorphism in actionâ€”one interface (Account) used for multiple class types.

public class Bank {

	public void showAccountDetails(Account account) {
		 System.out.println("Account Number: " + account.accountNumber);
	        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
	}
	
	public void applyInterest(Account account) {
		account.calculateInterest();
		System.out.println("Interest applied. New Balance: " + account.getBalance());
	}
}
